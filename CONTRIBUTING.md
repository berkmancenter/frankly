## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Frankly Code of Conduct](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/blob/staging/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <support@frankly.org>.


## I Have a Question

> Before you ask a question, it is best to search both the [Help Center](https://rebootingsocialmedia.notion.site/Frankly-Help-Center-23b4f9a120a344d4af2b2ce44b2ae229) and our existing [Issues](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/issues) to see if your question has been answered there.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/issues/new/choose).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

## I Want To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://rebootingsocialmedia.notion.site/Frankly-Help-Center-23b4f9a120a344d4af2b2ce44b2ae229). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in our [Github Issues](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <support@frankly.org>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/issues/new/choose) and select the appropriate issue type, then follow the prompts.

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps. Bugs that the team cannot reproduce will not be addressed until they are reproduced by the team.
- The project team will triage the issue accordingly.

### Your First Code Contribution

We would love for you to contribute to Frankly! To get started with setting up your development environment so you can start contributing, please refer to our [README](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly). The instructions there should allow you to run Frankly locally on your machine. 

Everything the Frankly team is working on is in the [Frankly Public Workstream](https://github.com/orgs/berkmancenter/projects/3). We would love your help, and that's the place to start. Look for anything in our backlog with the [help welcome](https://github.com/orgs/berkmancenter/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=-status%3A%22Won%27t+Do%22%2C%22Consider+Later%22+label%3A%22help+welcome%22) label especially, and we also have a [good first issue](https://github.com/orgs/berkmancenter/projects/3/views/1?filterQuery=-status%3A%22Won%27t+Do%22%2C%22Consider+Later%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+) label if you are a first time contributor looking for something to help with.

If the feature you want to work on requires third-party services (e.g. Agora for video calling, or Mux for running livestreams), please follow the instructions in the README to set up your own accounts. The free tiers of these services should allow for testing development use cases.

If you have any questions about the instructions, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/berkmancenter/frankly/issues/new). We welcome any suggestions for improvements to the README from contributors, especially as a Pull Request to the documentation itself. Thank you for your interest!
