## Repo contents

This subsection provides a description of the contents of major directories in the repo.  
**üí° Important note:** For the rest of this README, most terminal commands should be executed from within the `client` directory (or subdirectories of it when specified).

- `client`
  The main Flutter app.

- `data_models`
  These are the data models used by both the client and Firestore.

- `firebase/functions`
  These are the Firebase Functions which are deployed on Google Cloud and called by the Flutter app. Firebase functions are built on top of Cloud Functions.

- `firestore/firestore.rules`
  This is a Firestore security rules file which defines which Firestore documents are readable by which users.
