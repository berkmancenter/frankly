However, there are currently several things to keep in mind when creating or modifying Playwright tests specifically for our application:</p> <ol> <li>It is currently not possible for Playwright to identify any individual web elements in our Flutter app without enabling Flutter semantics, which creates a default Semantics tree in the DOM that allows Playwright Locators to find many of the elements they need to interact with. Until we properly address Semantics in the app, the test code needs to press the hidden \"Enable accessibility\" button on every page of our app. We use a test fixture defined in <code>custom-test-fixture.ts</code> to achieve this on every page load. All tests must use this fixture. Also note that this fixture contains some code for copying Playwright authentication data into IndexedDB on Chrome, as Playwright does not currently do this (see here for more information).</li> </ol> <p>To use the fixture, simply make sure you are importing 'test' from the correct location.</p> <p>Additionally, test creation can be simplified by using the Record capabilities in VSCode. However, accessibility must be enabled on the web pages for this to work as well. The easiest way to make this work is to temporarily modify the code to start with a default Semantics tree. Edit <code>client/lib/app.dart</code> as follows:</p>"},{"location":"e2e/#appdart","title":"<code>app.dart</code>","text":"<p>You can also trigger the hidden Enable Accessibility button by opening console in Chrome DevTools and executing <code>document.querySelector('flt-semantics-placeholder').click()</code></p> <ol> <li> <p>We have adopted Playwright's recommended Page Object Model to encapsulate the details of locating individual UI elements. Tests should not be using Playwright Locators directly. Rather, each page or dialog of the app should be modeled as a page in the <code>pages</code> folder, and tests should interact directly with that model.</p> </li> <li> <p>There is currently no way to specify a date or time when creating an event. As a result, new events are created with today's date, and the next hour as the start time. The current event pages are coded to handle this, but results may be inconsistent if there is more than one event with the same template and date.</p> </li> <li> <p>As of now, tests must tear down anything they create. We may decide later to create more default objects like events and templates in the global setup (to reduce test execution time), but care must be taken to avoid issues when running tests with parallel workers. Playwright has some recommendations for dealing with a shared state system during parallel execution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some UI elements are still not identifiable by the default Semantics tree. You may need to modify the code you are testing to add semantic labels. Many Flutter widgets have a semanticsLabel property, but if not, you can modify build methods to wrap widgets in a Semantics object as in the following example:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>    child: Semantics(label:'Submit Chat Button',button: true,\n              child: ActionButton(\n                minWidth: 20,\n                color: context.theme.colorScheme.primary,\n                controller: _sendController,\n                onPressed: canSubmit ? _sendMessage : null,\n                disabledColor: context.theme.colorScheme.onPrimary.withOpacity(0.3),\n                height: isMobile ? 50 : 55,\n                child: Icon(\n                  Icons.send,\n                  color: canSubmit ? context.theme.colorScheme.onPrimary : context.theme.colorScheme.onPrimaryContainer,\n                ),\n                ),\n              ),\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"\u2753 Troubleshooting and FAQ","text":""},{"location":"faq/#flutter-installation","title":"Flutter installation","text":"<ul> <li>If you install Android and you see this output when running <code>flutter doctor</code>:   <pre><code>[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 35.0.0)\n\u2717 cmdline-tools component is missing\nRun path/to/sdkmanager --install \"cmdline-tools;latest \n</code></pre>   Run the following steps: <ol> <li>Open Android Studio </li> <li>Select More Actions &gt; SDK Manager </li> <li>Under the SDK Tools tab, select Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest) (see screenshot below). </li> <li>Click Apply to proceed with installation.</li> </ol> </li> <li>When activating the FlutterFire CLI (step 1.3 in the Flutter doc: <code>dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli</code>), you may see a prompt to update your path:   <pre><code>Warning: Pub installs executables into $HOME/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.\n</code></pre>   You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.zshrc, .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):   <pre><code>export PATH=\"$PATH\":\"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin\"\n</code></pre>   After adding the recommended export to your ~/.zshrc file, restart all terminal windows.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faq/#cloud-functions-emulator","title":"Cloud Functions Emulator","text":"<ul> <li>Functions fail to emulate: If you run <code>firebase emulators:start --only ...</code> and you get a message saying that function emulation failed to start, you may need to run <code>firebase init functions</code> on first launch.
